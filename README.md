# aptos-monitoring

A monitoring solution for Aptos nodes utilizing docker containers with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), [Grafana](http://grafana.org/), [cAdvisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor),
[NodeExporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter), and alerting with [AlertManager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager). 

**Thank you to the Rhino Stake team for their [excellent dashboard](https://github.com/RhinoStake/aptos_monitoring)!**

## Install

Clone this repository on your Docker host, cd into aptos-monitoring directory and run compose up:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LavenderFive/aptos-monitoring
cd aptos-monitoring

ADMIN_USER=admin ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=JDJhJDE0JE91S1FrN0Z0VEsyWmhrQVpON1VzdHVLSDkyWHdsN0xNbEZYdnNIZm1pb2d1blg4Y09mL0ZP docker-compose up -d
```

**Caddy v2 does not accept plaintext passwords. It MUST be provided as a hash value. The above password hash corresponds to ADMIN_PASSWORD 'admin'. To know how to generate hash password, refer [Updating Caddy to v2](#Updating-Caddy-to-v2)**

Prerequisites:

* Docker Engine >= 1.13
* Docker Compose >= 1.11

Containers:

* Prometheus (metrics database) `http://<host-ip>:9090`
* Prometheus-Pushgateway (push acceptor for ephemeral and batch jobs) `http://<host-ip>:9091`
* AlertManager (alerts management) `http://<host-ip>:9093`
* Alertmanager-discord (disabled by default) `http://<host-ip>:9094`
* Grafana (visualize metrics) `http://<host-ip>:3000`
  * Infinity Plugin
* NodeExporter (host metrics collector)
* cAdvisor (containers metrics collector)
* Caddy (reverse proxy and basic auth provider for prometheus and alertmanager)

## Setup Grafana



### Aptos Grafana Dashboard
This monitoring solution comes built in with Rhinostake's Aptos Monitoring dashboard, and 
will require all of its setup to work. Grafana, Prometheus, and Infinity are installed 
automatically, but setting up the Prometheus jobs is still necessary. 

#### 1. Create Persistent Storage
To support persistent storage, you'll first need to create the volume:
```
docker volume create grafana-storage
```
#### 2. Prometheus Jobs
Add your node endpoints under [/prometheus/prometheus.yaml](https://github.com/LavenderFive/aptos-monitoring/blob/master/prometheus/prometheus.yml#L46). 

#### 3. Checkly Integation (optional)
1. Uncomment the checkly block under[/prometheus/prometheus.yaml](https://github.com/LavenderFive/aptos-monitoring/blob/master/prometheus/prometheus.yml#L54) 
2. Follow the steps outlined by [Checkly for Prometheus Integration](https://www.checklyhq.com/docs/integrations/prometheus/)

Navigate to `http://<host-ip>:3000` and login with user ***admin*** password ***admin***. You can change the credentials in the compose file or by supplying the `ADMIN_USER` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variables on compose up. The config file can be added directly in grafana part like this

```yaml
grafana:
  image: grafana/grafana:7.2.0
  env_file:
    - config
```

and the config file format should have this content

```yaml
GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER=admin
GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=changeme
GF_USERS_ALLOW_SIGN_UP=false
```

If you want to change the password, you have to remove this entry, otherwise the change will not take effect

```yaml
- grafana_data:/var/lib/grafana
```

Grafana is preconfigured with dashboards and Prometheus as the default data source:

* Name: Prometheus
* Type: Prometheus
* Url: [http://prometheus:9090](http://prometheus:9090)
* Access: proxy

***Monitor Services Dashboard***

![Monitor Services](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stefanprodan/dockprom/master/screens/Grafana_Prometheus.png)

The Monitor Services Dashboard shows key metrics for monitoring the containers that make up the monitoring stack:

* Prometheus container uptime, monitoring stack total memory usage, Prometheus local storage memory chunks and series
* Container CPU usage graph
* Container memory usage graph
* Prometheus chunks to persist and persistence urgency graphs
* Prometheus chunks ops and checkpoint duration graphs
* Prometheus samples ingested rate, target scrapes and scrape duration graphs
* Prometheus HTTP requests graph
* Prometheus alerts graph

## Define alerts

Two alert groups have been setup within the [alert.rules](https://github.com/stefanprodan/dockprom/blob/master/prometheus/alert.rules) configuration file:

* Monitoring services alerts [targets](https://github.com/stefanprodan/dockprom/blob/master/prometheus/alert.rules#L2-L11)
* Aptos alerts [aptos](https://github.com/LavenderFive/aptos-monitoring/blob/master/prometheus/alert.rules#L2-L11)

You can modify the alert rules and reload them by making a HTTP POST call to Prometheus:

```bash
curl -X POST http://admin:admin@<host-ip>:9090/-/reload
```

***Monitoring services alerts***

Trigger an alert if any of the monitoring targets (node-exporter and cAdvisor) are down for more than 30 seconds:

```yaml
- alert: monitor_service_down
    expr: up == 0
    for: 30s
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: "Monitor service non-operational"
      description: "Service {{ $labels.instance }} is down."
```

***Aptos alerts***

Trigger an alert if any of the mainnet Aptos nodes fall out of sync for 30 seconds.

```yaml
  - alert: node_not_syncing
  expr: avg(increase(aptos_state_sync_version{chain="mainnet", type="synced"}[30s])) < 1
  for: 15s
  labels:
    severity: critical
  annotations:
    summary: "Aptos Node Not Syncing"
    description: "Service {{ $labels.job }} {{ $labels.chain }} is not syncing."
```


## Setup alerting

The AlertManager service is responsible for handling alerts sent by Prometheus server.
AlertManager can send notifications via email, Pushover, Slack, HipChat or any other system that exposes a webhook interface.
A complete list of integrations can be found [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/configuration).

You can view and silence notifications by accessing `http://<host-ip>:9093`.

The notification receivers can be configured in [alertmanager/config.yml](https://github.com/stefanprodan/dockprom/blob/master/alertmanager/config.yml) file.

To receive alerts via Slack you need to make a custom integration by choose ***incoming web hooks*** in your Slack team app page.
You can find more details on setting up Slack integration [here](http://www.robustperception.io/using-slack-with-the-alertmanager/).

Copy the Slack Webhook URL into the ***api_url*** field and specify a Slack ***channel***.

```yaml
route:
    receiver: 'slack'

receivers:
    - name: 'slack'
      slack_configs:
          - send_resolved: true
            text: "{{ .CommonAnnotations.description }}"
            username: 'Prometheus'
            channel: '#<channel>'
            api_url: 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/<webhook-id>'
```
